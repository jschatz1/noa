# Noa Lang

## Intro

Noa Lang is a strongly typed, explicit language. It's purpose is to be explicit types of objects, while still allowing quick coding and prototyping.
Noa transpiles to JavaScript, and uses compile-time type checking.
Noa is similar to TypeScript in that it has type checking. The difference between Noa and TypeScript is that types do not get inferred and must be declared explicitly.
There is no `Any` types in Noa, and all variables must have an initial type declaration.
Noa has built in reactivity, and templates that area made to take advantage it.
